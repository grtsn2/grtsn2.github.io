#### Introduction
Quarrying was a major industry in the 19th century on the Channel Islands. At its height, 6 quarries were being worked on the islands producing both blue (Diorite) and pink (Granite Rose) granite.
 
Many quarrymen came to the island from Brittany and Cornwall in 1840s. The influx of newcomers doubled the population which provided an interesting blend of two Celtic cultures, as seen on the island today.

#### The Start

In 1883 The Granite Rose Quarry company built a 2-foot gauge railway. It first worked by draft horses, and then by steam locomotives starting in 1893. The railway hauled beautiful blue and pink granite, marketed as "Granite Rose" from island quarries #1 and #2 to the quarry at Wilshire[^1]. It was unofficially known as the Petite Tramway.

[^1]: There were 6 quarries on the island, four were worked by the Granite Rose company and the Petite Tramway. The other two were privately owned and worked first by draft horses, and then later by steam tractors pulling heavy wagons. These quarries were closed by 1906.

#### The Freight

Late in 1893, the Petite Tramway was extended across Millcreek on a stone viaduct to the village known as Mill. The village was the location of the new cutting and polishing mill. In 1895 the extension of the Tramway to quarries #3 and #4 and the village of Oak Park[^2] were built.  Also in 1895, the end of the blue granite deposit had been quarried out.

[^2]: The town names in this "history" are stand-ins until more suitable names from Channel Islands, Cornish, and French heritage replace them.

In 1898 the Petite Tramway was reorganized as the Granite Rose Tramway (still nicknamed the Petite Tramway) and immediately started hauling passengers and freight (indeed for many years the Tramway had been quietly hauling passengers). In addition granite the island also shipped salt from solar salt ponds, fish, particularly shellfish, seaweed, and produce (early season tomatoes). Incoming traffic was general supplies, brick, (used as ballast in the incoming ships that haul granite out) and coal.

The quarries shipped a variety of products including cut and finished Blue and Pink granite, paving sets, rough and crushed stone. Incoming quarry traffic includes supplies and fuel oil. Business peaked in 1907, totaling nearly 228,000 tons shipped.

#### The End

The Tramway began a long decline after World War I. Cut stone for buildings and crushed stone for roadways began being displaced by cement and asphalt after the war. Passenger service ended in 1933 and the Tramway closed in 1938. In the end the Tramway had shipped 2,147,975 tons of granite. Practically no trace is left of the Tramway, it's even hard to find the island on a map!
